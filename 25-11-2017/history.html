				<div class="content">
					<p>The land that gave birth to the legendary Orpheus and Spartacus, Bulgaria is a country with a long, 
					tumultuous and fascinating history. It has been invaded, conquered and settled by Greeks, 
					Scythians, Romans, Byzantines and Turks, all of whom left their indelible marks on the landscape. Bulgaria’s medieval ‘Golden Age’,
					when the Bulgar Khans ruled over one of the largest empires in Europe, was bright but brief, while 500 years of subsequent, brutal 
					Turkish domination isolated the country from the rest of Europe. Bulgaria earned its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878,
					but having fought on the losing side in both World Wars, it fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. 
					Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its first multi-party election since World War II and began the contentious
					process of moving toward political democracy and a market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption, and crime. 
					Bulgaria became a NATO member state in 2004 and joined the EU on 1 January 2007. </p>
