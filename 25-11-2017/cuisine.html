						<p>Bulgarian cuisine shares characteristics with other Balkans cuisines and it has been 
					influenced by the Turkish cuisine. The Bulgarian food is well known for it's diversity.
					For instance, it features a variety of soups, such as the cold soup Tarator or Skembe chorba
					-spicy soup made of trip, reputed in Bulgaria to be a "hangover cure". Moreover, Banitsa is one of the most popular 
					and consumed breakfast in Bulgaria. It's a pastry of eggs, white cheese and yogurt 
					between <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filo>phyllo</a> layers. Main courses are typically water-based stews,
					either vegetarian or with meat(Pork and lamb are common,but chicken is widely used too).In addtion, grilling is promenint way for 
					cooking in Bulgaria and is called skara. The most famous main grilled dishes are Kyufte(meatballs of minced pork meat, 
					seasoned with traditional spices and shaped in a flattened ball) and Kebapche (similar to meatballs, but seasoned with
					cumin and shaped in a stick). To conclude, Bulgarian sweets are simple but delicious. Pupmkin dessert and Kozunak(sweet leavened
					bread usually prepared for Easter) are good examples.
