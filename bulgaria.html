				<h2>History</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>The land that gave birth to the legendary Orpheus and Spartacus, Bulgaria is a country with a long, 
					tumultuous and fascinating history. It has been invaded, conquered and settled by Greeks, 
					Scythians, Romans, Byzantines and Turks, all of whom left their indelible marks on the landscape. Bulgaria’s medieval ‘Golden Age’,
					when the Bulgar Khans ruled over one of the largest empires in Europe, was bright but brief, while 500 years of subsequent, brutal 
					Turkish domination isolated the country from the rest of Europe. More recently, Bulgaria spent four decades as a totalitarian Soviet
					satellite, again leaving this small Balkan nation in the shadows as far as the Western world was concerned.In the last years of the 
					20th century Bulgaria began opening up, and is one of the newest members of the EU.</p>

				<h2>Landmarks</h2>
					<div class="content">
						<p>The long past of Bulgaria has left some remarkable sights and landmarks. A great example is Tsarevets - a fortress located on 
						a hill in Veliko Tarnovo in northern Bulgaria. It was the primary fortress of the Second Bulgarian Empire when Veliko Tarnovo was a
						capital. One of the oldest cities in Bulgaria is Plodviv, which attracts tourists from all over the world with it's ancient but 
						at the same time modern look. The city is based on seven hills, some of which are 250 metres high. Plovdiv has over 200 well preserved 
						archeological sites, for instance The Ancient Theatre which is situated between two of the Three hills (on which the city was built).
						Plovdiv has the longest pedestrian zone in Europe with total legnth of 1750m.</p>
