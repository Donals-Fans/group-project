						<h3>Tsarevets</h3>
						<p>The long past of Bulgaria has left some remarkable sights and landmarks. A great example is Tsarevets - a fortress located on 
						a hill in Veliko Tarnovo in northern Bulgaria. It was the primary fortress of the Second Bulgarian Empire when Veliko Tarnovo was a
						capital.It has three entrances. The main entrance is located in the easternmost side of the hill. The castle complex is located in the centre,
						surrounded by an internal stone wall, two battle towers and two entrances - north and south. It consists of a throne hall, castle church and 
						the king's chamber. The restoration of the fortress Tsarevets began in 1930 and was completed in 1981 in honour of the 1300 anniversary from 
						the establishment of the Bulgarian state. Kings Petar, Asen, Kaloyan and Ivan Asen the second lived there. </p>
						<h3>The Ancient Theatre in Plovdiv</h3>
						<p>One of the oldest cities in Bulgaria is Plodviv, which attracts tourists from all over the world with it's ancient but 
						at the same time modern look. The city is based on seven hills, some of which are 250 metres high. Plovdiv has over 200 well preserved 
						archeological sites, for instance The Ancient Theatre which is situated between two of the Three hills (on which the city was initially built).
						The open-air spectator’s area includes 28 concentric rows of marble seats, surrounding the stage– orchestra, which has the shape of a
						horseshoe with diameter 26.64 m. Apart from theatre performances, the venue was used for gladiatorial and hunting games.Nowadays, the Ancient 
						theatre is symbolical for Plovdiv and adjusted to the city’s modern cultural life. It is operating as a stage of opera, music and drama.</p>
						<h3>Kaliakra</h3>
						<p>Kaliakra is a long and narrow headland in the Southern Dobruja region of the northern Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.
						The coast is steep with vertical cliffs reaching 70 metres (230 ft) down to the sea.[1] Kaliakra is a nature reserve, where dolphins and cormorants can be observed.
						Probably the most popular legend about the place is one about 40 Bulgarian girls, who preferred to tie their hair together and jump into the Black Sea rather 
						than face the prospect of being captured by the Ottomans. An obelisk dedicated to this legend is placed at the entrance to the cape, called The Gate of the 40 Maidens.</p>
