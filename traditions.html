				<h2>Traditions</h2>

						<h3> Kukeri </h3>
						<p>A lot of traditions have been preserved during the Turkish domination and they are still observed in the present. 
					In Bulgaria there is a equivallent to Halloween, a ritual to scare away evil spirits. This event takes place twice a year in Bulgaria - the days around 
					New Yearâ€™s Eve and on the holiday of Sirni Zagovezni (celebrated seven weeks before Easter). The ritual is performed by men, called
					Kukeri, dressed with costumes, which include masks of animals, as well as bell rings attached to the belt.</p>
						<h3> Cross-searching in the cold waters</h3>
						<p>A prominent annual tradition for health 
					is performed every year on 7th of January, when a priest throws a cross in the cold waters of a river 
					and the one who gets it the first is going to be healthy 
					through the following year. Old beliefs dictate that if the cross freezes whilst in the water, the year will bring fertile crops.</p>
						<h3> Baba Marta</h3>
						<p>This is one of the most valued customs in Bulgaria, starting on 1st of March and celebrating the beginning of spring.
						Everyone gives each other white and red tassel. The red color symbolize health and the white one - luck. 
						They are only taken off when you see a stork or a blossoming tree, which symbolise the messengers of the arrival of the warmer season.</p>
